# Power-BI-Visualizations

**Overview**
This repository is a collection of Power BI dashboards and reports showcasing data visualization and analysis skills. Developed using Microsoft Power BI, the projects demonstrate expertise in creating interactive dashboards, leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations, and transforming raw data into actionable insights. Each project focuses on a specific dataset or domain, such as sales performance, financial analytics, or customer behavior, to provide meaningful visualizations and business intelligence solutions.
Features

**Interactive Dashboards:** Dynamic visuals with slicers, drill-downs, and cross-filtering for user-friendly data exploration.
**DAX-Powered Calculations:** Custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analytics (e.g., year-over-year growth, KPI tracking).
**Diverse Visuals:** Includes charts (bar, line, pie), matrices, cards, decomposition trees, and custom visuals from Power BI AppSource.
**Data Modeling:** Well-structured data models with optimized relationships and hierarchies.
**Real-World Applications:** Projects inspired by industry use cases, such as retail, finance, or HR analytics.
